As of Quarter 3, 2021:

**Lead Safe Resource Center**

* We see a steady increase in the number of new callers in each quarter. In Q3 2021, there were 1,026 callers, up from 717 in Q2 2021. The majority of callers were seeking assistance related to the Lead Safe Ordinance and the Lead Safe Certification process.

**Lead Safe Home Fund**

* Most of the applications for financial assistance submitted as of Q3 2021 were from properties located in Zone 1, followed by Zone 2 and Zone 3, which is aligned with the rollout timeline.


* A sizable increase in applications is evident over timeâ€“136 applications in Q3 2021 compared to 97 applications in Q2 2021 and 77 applications in Q1 2021.


**Lead Safe Certifications**

* Approval of submitted applications continues to be very high.

* By the end of the third quarter, applications for lead safe certification had grown considerably. The third quarter far outpaced activity in the first two quarters.

* In Q3 2021 380 certifications were issued.

* While this strong upward trend is encouraging, compared to the numbers of properties subject to the Lead Safe ordinance in roll-out Zones 1-3, the numbers involved in a lead safe certification application continue to reflect low compliance.
