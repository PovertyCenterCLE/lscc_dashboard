We believe that no child should ever be lead poisoned. That is why we're
working with XXX organizations to make housing lead safe for everyone in
Cleveland. All homes built before 1978 used lead paint, so the [City of
Cleveland](https://cityofcleveland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3971384&GUID=55AA3B1D-224B-41FD-B228-FC528D10269C&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=lead)
is requiring that all rental properties built before 1978 have a Lead
Safe Certification. This certification [ensures that homes are lead
safe](https://leadsafecle.org/6steps). Starting March 2021, phases of
[zip code groups](https://leadsafecle.org/zip-code-groupings) will be
required to get the certification.

<br>

The [**Lead Safe Cleveland Data Dashboard**](https://cwru-urb-pov.shinyapps.io/lead_flexdashboard_shiny_selected_vars_mjh_ams_2_10_2021/) is designed to give you quick
answers to questions you may have about the rollout and impact of the
Cleveland Lead Safe Ordinance.

<br>

Hereâ€™s a sample of some of the questions the dashboard can help answer:
