No child should ever be lead poisoned. The [Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition](https://leadsafecle.org) is working to make housing lead safe for everyone in Cleveland. 


Most homes built before 1978 used lead paint, which poses a danger for children. The [City of Cleveland](https://cityofcleveland.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3971384&GUID=55AA3B1D-224B-41FD-B228-FC528D10269C&Options=ID%7CText%7C&Search=lead) now requires that all rental properties built before 1978 have a Lead Safe Certification. That means the home has been inspected by a certified professional and [does not have any current lead hazards.](https://leadsafecle.org/6steps). All rentals will have to get a certification starting in March 2021, [a few ZIP codes at a time](https://leadsafecle.org/zip-code-groupings).

<br>

The [**Lead Safe Cleveland Coalition Data Dashboard**](https://cwru-urb-pov.shinyapps.io/lead_flexdashboard_blank_3_30_2021/) has answers to common questions and information on the rollout of this new law and how it is affecting children, families and neighborhoods.

Here are just a few of the questions the dashboard can help answer:
